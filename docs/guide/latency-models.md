# Latency Models

The `LatencyModel` interface determines how BLIS estimates GPU step time for each batch iteration. BLIS ships two backends -- **trained-physics** (default, physics-informed roofline with MoE-aware corrections) and **roofline** (pure analytical) -- and the pluggable architecture supports adding custom backends.

**Migration note:** Three legacy backends have been removed (`blackbox`, `crossmodel`, `trained-roofline`). Use `--latency-model trained-physics` instead, which supersedes all three with improved accuracy and MoE support.

```bash
# Trained-physics mode (default) — roofline × architecture-aware basis functions × learned corrections
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500

# Roofline mode — pure analytical estimation from model architecture (explicit flag)
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b \
  --latency-model roofline --hardware H100 --tp 1 \
  --num-instances 4 --rate 100 --num-requests 500
```

## Trained-Physics Mode (Default)

Trained-physics mode combines roofline basis functions with learned correction coefficients. It provides better out-of-box accuracy than pure roofline by capturing architecture-specific overheads (MoE routing, memory access patterns) that analytical models miss.

**Benefits:**
- Better generalization across model architectures and TP configurations
- Lower MAPE in practice compared to pure roofline
- No per-model calibration needed

Use this for capacity planning and what-if analysis unless you specifically need pure analytical estimates.

## Roofline Mode

Roofline mode computes step time analytically from model architecture (FLOPs, parameter count) and hardware specifications (compute throughput, memory bandwidth). It does not require pre-trained coefficients, making it suitable for new models.

### The `--latency-model roofline` Flag

The simplest way to use roofline mode:

```bash
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b \
  --latency-model roofline --hardware H100 --tp 1
```

This auto-resolves both required inputs:

1. **Model config** -- checks `model_configs/` for a cached `config.json`, fetches from HuggingFace on miss
2. **Hardware config** -- uses the bundled `hardware_config.json`

**Supported hardware:** The bundled `hardware_config.json` includes specs for **H100** (80 GB HBM3, 989.5 TFLOPS BF16, 3.35 TB/s), **A100-SXM** (80 GB HBM2e, 312 TFLOPS BF16, 2.04 TB/s), and **A100-80** (alias for A100-SXM). To use a different GPU, add an entry to `hardware_config.json` with the required fields (`TFlopsPeak`, `BwPeakTBs`, `mfuPrefill`, `mfuDecode`, `MemoryGiB`) and reference it via `--hardware <name>`.

**Validated models:** Any dense or MoE transformer with a HuggingFace `config.json` works. The following have been validated end-to-end:

- [Llama-2-7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf) / [Llama-2-70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf)
- [Qwen3-14B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B)
- [Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) (MoE)
- [CodeLlama-34B](https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-34b-Instruct-hf)

Set `HF_TOKEN` to access gated models (e.g., [Llama-2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf)) and avoid rate limits:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
./blis run --model meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  --latency-model roofline --hardware H100 --tp 1
```

### Manual Configuration

For full control, provide configs explicitly:

```bash
./blis run --model my-custom-model \
  --model-config-folder ./my-model-configs/ \
  --hardware-config ./my-hardware-config.json \
  --hardware H100 --tp 4
```

### Adding Support for New Models

Any model with a HuggingFace `config.json` can use roofline mode:

1. Download `config.json` from HuggingFace
2. Place it in `model_configs/<model-name>/config.json`
3. Run with `--latency-model roofline --hardware <GPU> --tp <N>`

Or let BLIS fetch it automatically with `--latency-model roofline`.

### Tensor Parallelism and Roofline

The `--tp` flag divides FLOPs and memory traffic across TP ranks:

- Higher TP reduces per-GPU step time (more parallelism)
- Higher TP reduces KV blocks per GPU (memory split across ranks)

When choosing between TP and replication (more instances): TP reduces per-request latency, replication increases throughput. For capacity planning, simulate both configurations.

!!! note "Automatic KV block calculation"
    For both latency backends (roofline, trained-physics), `--total-kv-blocks` is automatically derived from model architecture and GPU memory if not explicitly set. The auto-calculated value accounts for TP (KV heads are sharded across ranks; total GPU memory scales with GPU count). Override with `--total-kv-blocks <N>` for non-standard deployments. The auto-calculation uses reference constants (90% GPU utilization, standard activation/overhead budgets matching the llm-d-benchmark capacity planner) and requires SwiGLU-family activations.

!!! note "Automatic MaxModelLen derivation"
    When using roofline or trained-physics mode and `--max-model-len` is not explicitly set, BLIS auto-derives it from `max_position_embeddings` in the HuggingFace `config.json`. For models with `rope_scaling`, the scaling factor is applied based on vLLM's blacklist approach: types `linear`, `dynamic`, `yarn`, `default`, and `mrope` apply the factor; types `su`, `longrope`, and `llama3` are excluded (these encode the full context in `max_position_embeddings`). For `yarn`, `original_max_position_embeddings` is used as the base when present. `gemma3` models skip `rope_scaling` entirely (`max_position_embeddings` is pre-scaled). The derived value is then capped at the KV-feasible maximum (`total_kv_blocks * block_size`) to prevent context windows from exceeding GPU memory capacity. Override with `--max-model-len` <N>` when needed.

## How Trained-Physics Works

Trained-physics mode applies **learned correction factors** to analytical roofline basis functions, combining the physical grounding of roofline with the accuracy of data-driven fitting. Coefficients are fitted from real vLLM measurements and generalize across model architectures, workloads, and TP configurations.

**StepTime formula** (10 beta coefficients in bundled defaults):

```
StepTime = β₁ₐ × T_pf_compute                  # prefill compute only
         + β₁ᵦ × T_pf_kv                       # prefill memory (typically ~0)
         + β₂ₐ × T_dc_compute                  # decode compute (typically ~0)
         + β₂ᵦ × T_dc_kv                       # decode memory only
         + β₃ × T_weight                       # weight loading × correction
         + β₄ × T_tp                           # TP communication × correction
         + β₅ × L                              # per-layer overhead (µs/layer)
         + β₆ × batch_size                     # per-request scheduling (µs/req)
         + β₇                                  # per-step fixed overhead (µs)
         + β₈ × nMoE                           # per-MoE-layer overhead (µs/layer)
```

The model supports 7-11 beta coefficients. Bundled defaults use 11 coefficients (prefill/decode split + the MoE expert-parallel dispatch correction β_EP).

**Beta coefficients:**

- **β₁ₐ** (prefill compute, ~0.15): Corrects analytical FlashAttention + MLP FLOP estimates for kernel efficiency, memory access patterns.
- **β₁ᵦ** (prefill memory, ~0): Prefill KV cache write bandwidth correction (typically near zero).
- **β₂ₐ** (decode compute, ~0): Decode compute correction (typically near zero, decode is memory-bound).
- **β₂ᵦ** (decode memory, ~1.9): Corrects KV cache read bandwidth. Primary decode bottleneck.
- **β₃** (weight loading, ~1.4): Corrects model weight bandwidth for cache effects, prefetching, HBM contention.
- **β₄** (TP communication, ~0.75): Corrects tensor-parallel All-Reduce overhead.
- **β₅** (per-layer, ~32 µs/layer): Fixed overhead per transformer layer: kernel launch, CUDA graph, residual connections.
- **β₆** (per-request, ~4 µs/request): Scheduling overhead per request: queue management, attention mask construction.
- **β₇** (per-step, ~126 µs/step): Fixed overhead per step: CUDA synchronization, sampler invocation.
- **β₈** (MoE-layer, ~482 µs/layer): Per-MoE-layer overhead for router gating, token permutation. Architecture-aware: applies only to interleaved MoE architectures (InterleaveMoELayerStep > 0). Zero for uniform MoE and dense models.
- **β_EP** (MoE dispatch/combine, defaults to β₄): Corrects MoE expert-/data-parallel dispatch+combine all-to-all communication. Active only for MoE models with `--dp > 1`. Defaults to β₄ because both comm-backend families run over the same NVLink fabric and share the ring-collective per-phase efficiency β₄ captures (the per-family *volume* difference is in the basis, not the coefficient). The 11th coefficient overrides the default.

**Alpha coefficients** (3 terms, API/framework overheads in µs):

- **α₀** (QueueingTime, ~15,563 µs): Fixed per-request API processing (HTTP parsing, request validation, queue insertion).
- **α₁** (PostDecodeFixedOverhead, ~777 µs): Fixed per-request post-decode overhead (detokenization setup, finish reason determination).
- **α₂** (OutputTokenProcessingTime, ~46 µs/token): Per-output-token overhead (streaming token transmission, incremental detokenization).

**Pre-trained coefficients** are stored in `trained_physics_coefficients` in `defaults.yaml`. No per-model calibration needed -- the model generalizes across architectures, workloads, and TP configurations.

### Generalization Scope

The trained-physics model is designed to generalize without per-model calibration:

**Supported hardware:**

- **H100** (80 GB HBM3, 989.5 TFLOPS BF16 / 1979 TFLOPS FP8, 3.35 TB/s)
- **A100-SXM** (80 GB HBM2e, 312 TFLOPS BF16, 2.04 TB/s)
- **A100-80** (alias for A100-SXM)
- **L40S** (48 GB GDDR6, 362 TFLOPS BF16 / 1466 TFLOPS FP8, 0.864 TB/s)

**Coefficients were trained on H100 traces** but the roofline basis functions automatically scale to each GPU's compute/bandwidth specifications via hardware config. This enables the model to generalize across hardware without GPU-specific calibration.

**Model architectures:**

- **Dense transformers** (Llama-2, Qwen3, GPT, etc.): Standard attention + MLP layers
- **Uniform MoE** (Mixtral): All layers are MoE with top-k expert routing
- **Interleaved MoE** (Scout): Alternating MoE and dense layers with architecture-specific β₈ overhead

The model automatically detects MoE configuration from `config.json` (`num_local_experts`, `num_experts_per_tok`, `interleave_moe_layer_step`) and adjusts basis functions accordingly.

**Workload types:**

- **Prefill-heavy** (large input, short output): Chatbot prompts, document Q&A
- **Decode-heavy** (small input, long output): Content generation, code completion
- **Mixed batches** (concurrent prefill/decode): Production serving with heterogeneous requests
- **TP configurations**: TP=1, TP=2, TP=4, TP=8 (All-Reduce overhead scales via β₄)

**Why trained-physics over roofline:**

Trained-physics uses up to **14 coefficients** (11 beta: prefill compute/memory split, decode compute/memory split, weight, TP, layer overhead, batch overhead, step overhead, MoE overhead, and the MoE expert-parallel dispatch correction β_EP; 3 alpha: queueing, post-decode, per-token) that capture more architectural detail than pure roofline (no learned corrections). The prefill/decode split (β₁ₐ/β₁ᵦ, β₂ₐ/β₂ᵦ) and MoE-specific overhead (β₈) enable better generalization to unseen model architectures (especially interleaved MoE) and batch compositions (mixed prefill/decode).

!!! note "MoE architecture detection"
    β₈ applies conditionally based on `InterleaveMoELayerStep` from the model's `config.json`: 0 = uniform MoE (β₈ skipped), 1 = alternating MoE/dense (β₈ × 24 layers for Scout's 48 total), 2 = every 3rd layer is MoE, etc. This prevents over-penalizing uniform MoE models like Mixtral where expert routing overhead is amortized across all layers.

### Data + Expert Parallelism for MoE (trained-physics only)

For MoE deployments, trained-physics models data parallelism (`--dp`) and expert parallelism (`--enable-expert-parallel`) the way vLLM does (mirrors `vllm-project/vllm`):

- **Routed-expert weight/compute** are scoped to the flattened MoE group `moeGroup = TP·DP` via the `ExpertPlacement` seam: each GPU holds `numExperts/moeGroup` full-expert-equivalents (EP-off tensor-shards them; EP-on owns whole experts — the per-GPU bytes are identical). This replaces a batch-dependent heuristic and is **EP-mode-agnostic**, so MoE step time at `DP=1` intentionally differs from pre-DP/EP BLIS (a deliberate fidelity fix). Dense models at `DP=1` are byte-identical (INV-BC-DP1).
- **Sequence-split terms** (attention/dense-FFN compute, KV read/write) gain a `/dp` factor — each DP rank processes ~`1/dp` of the tokens. Weights stay `/tp` (replicated across DP groups).
- **Shared experts** (DeepSeek/Qwen-style) are charged for every token when the model exposes a shared-expert FFN dim; a no-op otherwise (including Llama-4 Scout until its shared-expert dim — `config.intermediate_size`, not `intermediate_size_mlp` which is the dense-layer FFN — is mapped).
- **MoE-FFN communication** partitions on the `DP` boundary: at `DP=1, TP>1` an all-reduce over the TP group; at `DP>1` a dispatch/combine all-to-all (β_EP).

**`--moe-comm-backend`** selects the dispatch/combine cost model (mirrors vLLM `VLLM_ALL2ALL_BACKEND`). The seven names map to two physical volume families:

| Family | Backends | Per-rank dispatch volume |
|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| all-gather | `naive`, `allgather_reducescatter` (default) | dense hidden states, **no top_k** |
| modular all-to-all | `pplx`, `deepep_high_throughput`, `deepep_low_latency`, `mori`, `flashinfer_all2allv` | top_k-routed tokens (carries `kEff`) |

DP/EP and `--moe-comm-backend` require `--latency-model trained-physics` (roofline is DP/EP-blind for step time) and are rejected on dense models for `--dp > 1` (dense data parallelism is the router-replica mechanism — use `--num-instances`). Absolute MoE communication magnitudes are physics-estimated with β_EP defaulted to β₄; an empirical re-fit is future work.

#### Calibrating β_EP

The β₄ default assumes the dispatch/combine collective runs at the same per-byte efficiency as the TP all-reduce — true when both share one NVLink fabric, but not when EP spans nodes (e.g. inter-node InfiniBand for EP while TP stays intra-node NVLink). To fit β_EP for such a deployment:

1. Collect real per-step latencies for a **MoE model at `--dp > 1`** with a fixed `--moe-comm-backend`, holding everything else constant.
2. Freeze the other 10 β coefficients (and the α coefficients) at their bundled values.
3. Fit only β_EP to the residual between observed step time and the model's prediction with the dispatch term zeroed — i.e. attribute the leftover to `β_EP · tMoEDispatch`.

Because the dispatch term is the *only* term gated on `DP > 1`, the residual isolates it cleanly. Fit per comm-backend *family* (all-gather vs all-to-all), not per backend name; see the PR #1433 discussion for why per-backend scalars are the wrong granularity (the within-family differences are prefill/decode shape effects a single scalar cannot represent).

## When to Use Which

| Aspect | Roofline | Trained-Physics (default) |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|
| **When to use** | Quick analytical estimate | Default (generalizes across architectures, workloads, TP) |
| **Data required** | HF `config.json` + `--hardware` + `--tp` | HF `config.json` + `--hardware` + `--tp` (global coefficients bundled) |
| **GPU step time accuracy** | Good (analytical) | Better (13 global params, physics-informed basis functions) |
| **MoE support** | Yes (per-expert FLOPs + effective expert count) | Yes (per-expert FLOPs + effective expert count + β₈ per-MoE-layer overhead) |
| **Alpha model** | α₀ + α₁·inputLen (constant + per-token queueing) | α₀ (constant), α₁ (post-decode fixed), α₂ (per-token) |
| **PostDecodeFixedOverhead** | 0 | α₁ (~777µs) |

!!! tip "Choosing the right mode"
    **Trained-physics** is the default for any model with a HuggingFace `config.json` (generalizes across architectures, workloads, and TP configurations without per-model calibration). **Roofline** for pure analytical estimates when no learned corrections are desired.

!!! warning "Current limitations"
    All analytical latency models support tensor parallelism (TP). Data parallelism (DP) and expert parallelism (EP) scheduling overhead are not yet modeled. Quantized weight precision (GPTQ, AWQ, FP8, compressed-tensors) is auto-detected from `quantization_config`, model name conventions (e.g., `w4a16`, `FP8`), or `torch_dtype` fallback, and is used for weight bandwidth and KV capacity calculations. MFU calibration values are still derived from FP16/BF16 measurements.

## Pluggable Architecture

The `LatencyModel` interface (defined in `sim/latency_model.go`) has four methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `StepTime(batch)` | Duration of one batch step given the running batch |
| `QueueingTime(req)` | Arrival-to-queue delay for a request |
| `OutputTokenProcessingTime()` | Per-token post-processing time |
| `PostDecodeFixedOverhead()` | Fixed per-request overhead at completion (0 for roofline, non-zero for trained-physics) |

All time estimates are in microseconds (ticks).

New backends register via the `NewLatencyModelFunc` variable in `sim/latency_model.go`. The `sim/latency/register.go` file uses `init()` to wire the factory, breaking the import cycle between `sim/` (interface owner) and `sim/latency/` (implementation). To add a custom backend, implement the four methods and register your factory via `init()` in a sub-package. See [Extension Recipes](../contributing/extension-recipes.md) for a step-by-step guide.
