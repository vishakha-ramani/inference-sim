// ResidentAdapterSet is the per-instance view of the finite resident LoRA adapter
// slots: a capacity-bounded resident set of adapter ids. The Simulator uses it to
// track which adapters are "loaded" on the instance as requests are scheduled. The
// concrete implementation (an LRU) lives in sim/lora and is wired in via
// NewResidentAdapterSetFunc, mirroring NewAdapterRegistryFunc / NewLatencyModelFunc,
// so sim/ can own the state without importing sim/lora (Principle I: no reverse
// import).
//
// The interface is scoped to what the scheduling hook and the cold-load
// pre-admission gate consume (R13). The gate (#1466) added AtCapacity / EvictLRU
// (to commit an eviction victim and reserve a slot at load-start) and Pin / Unpin
// (to protect an adapter in use by an in-flight request from eviction, INV-L5).

	// provider, which collapses the result into RoutingSnapshot.ResidentAdapters as a
