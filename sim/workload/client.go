// normalizeRateFractions normalizes client rate fractions and returns per-client
// rates in requests/microsecond.
//
// When no client has lifecycle windows, fractions are normalized globally (sum to 1.0).
// When lifecycle windows are present, fractions are normalized per-phase: each
// client's fraction is divided by the sum of fractions of all co-active clients
// (those whose lifecycle windows overlap). This ensures aggregate_rate is achieved
// during every active phase, not diluted by clients in non-overlapping phases.
//
// Clients without lifecycle windows are "always-on" and overlap with everything.
//
// Limitation: always-on clients compute a single rate using co-active sums across
// ALL phases they overlap with. When combined with multiple non-overlapping phased
// clients, the always-on client's rate is diluted by the union of all phases, so
// per-phase totals may be less than aggregate_rate. A fully phase-aware algorithm
// (computing separate rates per discrete time interval) would fix this but is
// significantly more complex.
